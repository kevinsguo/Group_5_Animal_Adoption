# Group_5_Animal_Adoption

# Presentation

## Selected topic

The purpose of this analysis is to review data on animals in the Austin Animal Center to better understand the inventory of the animals and to create a model that predicts the outcome whether that is:

- Adoption
- Transfer
- Return to Owner
- Euthanesia
- Died



## Reason for selecting this topic

The Austin Animal Shelter is the largest no-kill animal shelter in the United States and houses 18,000 animals each year. The shelter is an open intake facility where all lost or surrendered animals are accepted. As the city of Austin grows the number of animal intakes will increase making the burden on the shelter greater. The ability of the shelter to remain no-kill is dependent on having available room to house all of the animals and makes understanding the outcome of the animals and the success of the adoption program incential.
