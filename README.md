# Group_5_Animal_Adoption

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to review data on animals in the Austin Animal Center to better understand the inventory of the animals and to create a model that predicts the outcome whether that is:

- Adoption
- Transfer
- Return to Owner
- Euthanesia
- Died

The Austin Animal Center is the largest no-kill animal shelter in the United States and houses 18,000 animals each year.  The shelter is an open intake facility where all lost or surrendered animals are accepted.  The ability of the shelter to remain no-kill by having available room to house all of the animals makes understanding the outcome of the animals and the success of the adoption program incential.

Further analysis will also include review of other main factors and their correlation to the outcome.  Some of these factors are length of stay, age, color and location of where found.
